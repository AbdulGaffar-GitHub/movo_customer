/// triggers an action when pressed.

/// The [title] parameter is required and is used as the text inside the chip.
/// The [onDeleted] parameter is required and is the callback function that is executed
/// when the delete icon is pressed.

/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// ChipMultiselectField(
///   title: 'Selected Item',
///   onDeleted: () {
///     // Handle deletion
///   },
/// )
/// ```
